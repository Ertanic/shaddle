# About

**Shaddle** (sharp + cuddle) is a toy project aimed at implementing the KDL parser.
Due to the project being in a **WIP** state, things like multi-line strings or KDL version annotation support may be missing.
KDL version 2 is implemented by default and there are **no** plans to support version 1.
